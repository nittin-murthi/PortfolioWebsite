    description: "Current Sophomore as a Computer Engineering major. I have currently completed coursework in fundamental digital logic design and embedded systems which provided me with a strong background in Assembly through the LC-3 and C/C++ with a strong background in mathematics and physics having completed coursework in three dimensional calculus and foundational linear algebra. I plan on conentrating within the field of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence through my technical electives in my upcoming years. I have already participated and gained valuable experience through research project within the field working under the suprvision of knowledgable professors and PhD Students.",

    description: "As an LLM Integration Engineer at Ecoservity Inc, I led the development of a state-of-the-art conversational bot using Llama 3, OpenAI API, llama-index, PandasAI and HuggingFace, achieving remarkable user engagement and satisfaction rates. I also engineered seamless data integration pathways for data analysis, boosting data accessibility and retrieval efficiency and most importantly data derived insights for further analysis. I implemented advanced techniques like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to fine-tune large language models and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) throughout the processes to continually optimize the accuracy and efficiency of the model. I closely collaborated with the CEO in order to deploy it on the companyâ€™s AWS server and Microsoft PowerBI. Finally, I was able to integrate all the existing capabilities of the bot with SQL and .json data formats using PandasAI.",

    description: "In an effort to enhance the learning experience for students enrolled in the introductory computer architecture design course ECE120, I developed an Artificial Intelligence-based Teaching Assistant. Leveraging Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques with Langchain and ChromaDB, I provided assistance to students in C programming. To find the optimal balance between cost and performance, I experimented with multiple open-source and closed-source Large Language Models (LLMs), including Llama 3, LLama 2, Code-Llama, Mistral, GPT 3.5, and GPT-4. Additionally, I read research papers on novel RAG techniques such as self-correcting RAGs and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), successfully implementing them to improve the overall performance of the Teaching Assistant.",
